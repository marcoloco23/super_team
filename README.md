**Superteam**

Superteam is a basketball analytics framework for identifying strong competitive teams from individual player performances. By collecting large amounts of detailed player performance statistics over more than 10000 NBA games, an XGB regression model is trained to predict a teams plus minus score for a specific game from the corresponding collective player performances of both teams.

To get started, check out the jupyter notebook article for more information where you can simply run a tournament, simulate a matchup, or find a new super team.

All data is fetched using the python nba_api and is stored using MongoDB.
