Collects various box score statistics for each player after every game. Then calculates the team average statistics weighted by the minutes played of individual players and calculates the standard deviation of box score statistics. Then compares these reults to the opposing teams statisitics and computes the relative difference between the two. A regression model then takes this data and maps it to the total point difference of the game.

The performances of each player after each game are stored in order to calculate their average performance over a given time interval. Teams can then be created by selecting groups of players. Again, we can calculate mean and standard deviations of player performances for each team let them matchup by running the regression model.

An elimination tournament then identifies the strongest teams similar to how it does in the actual NBA.
